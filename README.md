👋 Hi, I’m @TimothyWatkins2

👀 I'm a seasoned professional with 15 years of experience in C/AL AL language, from the earliest versions of Navision to today's SaaS version of Business Central. I'm passionate about optimizing the way we work as IT professionals and how end users interact with ERP systems.

🌱 I believe in continuous learning, both on the job and off, and I'm always eager to discover new techniques as well as refine well-established ones. Collaboration is key to my approach, particularly when it comes to exploring new coding techniques and optimizing existing code.

💞️ I'm not one to accept "it's always been done that way" as an answer. I enjoy pushing boundaries, questioning the status quo, and finding innovative solutions to complex problems.

📫 Feel free to reach out to me via Teams or email (either my KPMG or Wiise address). I look forward to connecting and collaborating with you!
